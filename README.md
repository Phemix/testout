## 3. Text Formatting


Normal text would appear like this, the *br* tag is a html tag that simply inserts a newline, you can use two of them to insert two new lines and yes i'm about to use one right now
<br/>

italics, with *asterisks* 

Strong emphasis, aka bold, with **asterisks**

bold and asteriks **_asterisks_** 

Strikethrough uses two tildes. ~~strike~~
